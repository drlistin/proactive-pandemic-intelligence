# Notebooks Overview

This folder will contain Jupyter notebooks for exploration, prototyping, and reporting.

Planned notebooks:

1. **01_signal_synthesis.ipynb**  
   Generate synthetic multi-signal data and save outputs into `/data/raw/synthetic/`.

2. **02_preprocessing_and_features.ipynb**  
   Apply preprocessing + feature engineering. Save outputs to `/data/processed/features/`.

3. **03_modeling_experiments.ipynb**  
   Train anomaly-detection models and evaluate using planned metrics.

4. **04_scenario_analysis.ipynb**  
   Run what-if outbreak scenarios and test alert thresholds.

Notebooks are for experimentation; production code will eventually move into `/src/`.
