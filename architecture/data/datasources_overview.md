1. Search Trends

Example: Google Trends, NHS symptom-search logs
Used for: early spikes in symptom-related searches.

2. Emergency Department (ED) Visits

Example: Respiratory-related triage codes
Used for: detection of clinical signal onset.

3. Prescription Patterns

Example: Antibiotic, steroid, antiviral prescription surges
Used for: behavioural clinical signal.

4. Wearable Signals

Example: Resting HR, temperature, sleep disruption
Used for: population-level subtle physiological changes.

5. Wastewater & Genomics

Example: viral RNA counts, variant emergence
Used for: early pathogen detection before clinical events.

Real or synthetic datasets will be added later under /data/raw/.
