1. Problem Definition

Early detection of emerging respiratory threats before they reach outbreak levels.

2. Stakeholders

Public health agencies

Hospitals and health systems

Epidemiologists

AI/ML teams

Data engineers

Government disease-surveillance units

3. Project Objectives

Detect early anomaly signals 7–21 days before outbreak recognition.

Integrate multi-signal data (clinical + non-clinical).

Provide severity-weighted risk scoring.

Generate automated alerts for epidemiology teams.

Build a scalable and reproducible surveillance pipeline.

4. AI Use-Case Classification 

✔ Decision support
✔ Automation (early detection alerts)
✔ Personalized interaction (regional or hospital-specific projections)

5. Key Questions 

Where do backlogs or delays exist in current surveillance?

Which decisions critically impact public health response time?

How can early anomaly detection improve throughput and reduce risk?

What pain points exist in current epidemiological workflows?

6. SMART Goals

Specific: Detect anomalies with false-positive rate <15%.

Measurable: Identify threats at least 10 days earlier than baseline reporting.

Achievable: Based on available multi-signal data streams.

Realistic: Uses globally available open-source data + synthetic clinical datasets.

Timely: Produce risk updates every 24 hours.

7. Assumptions

Multi-signal data streams available

Latency < 24 hours for ingestion

Regional granularity possible

Synthetic clinical datasets acceptable for demo purposes
